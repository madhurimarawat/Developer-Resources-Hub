Decentralized ?

Decentralized is a term used to describe a system that is not owned or controlled by a single entity, such as a government, bank, or company.

Since decentralized services do not rely on a centralized authority, they possess several benefits including censorship resistance, increased security, and resistance to hacking and manipulation.

For example, Bitcoin is a type of decentralized currency since it is not owned by a bank or government. Records of all transactions are stored on ledgers which are then maintained on a network of computers owned by users around the world.


Why Decentralization ?

Decentralization allows you to maintain independent control and decision-making.

The direction and future of your system aren’t dependent on the integrity of any single authority.

If a single authority ever becomes corrupt, damaged, or compromised, the entire organization has the potential to collapse.

Blockchain


Blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way.

A digital database containing information (such as records of financial transactions) that can be simultaneously used and shared within a large decentralized, publicly accessible network.

Smart Contracts

A smart contract is a computer program or a transaction protocol that is intended to automatically execute, control or document events and actions according to the terms of a contract or an agreement.
The objectives of smart contracts are the reduction of need for trusted intermediators, arbitration costs, and fraud losses, as well as the reduction of malicious and accidental exceptions.
